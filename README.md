# myLibrary App

A simple library project that stores book objects in an array using a constructor with a function that loops through arrays to display a book with the details of the author, title, number of pages, and if it has been read or not.

Using a button, the user is able to add a new book to their library and also be able to remove a book from the library.
The user is also able to toggle the read status of any book.

The library is also saved onto local storage to enable persistent data for when the user refreshes the webpage.
